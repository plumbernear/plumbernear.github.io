<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, available in a single-tank "cabinet" style. It is highly recommended for either municipal or well water materials. Nobody wishes to stroll into a kitchen or a bathroom and discover a sink loaded with black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be operating appropriately in order to support hygienic and safe living conditions as well.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated correctly in the drain locknut, then tighten up the drain and reinstall locknut. Lastly, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>

You may have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
