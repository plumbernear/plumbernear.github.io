<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
