<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Things such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can end up being trapped between your drainpipe and your pipes.

<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience blockages in numerous drains at once in your home, then that generally means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in numerous places and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your home.</p>
