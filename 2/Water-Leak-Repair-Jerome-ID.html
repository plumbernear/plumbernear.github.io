<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Jerome ID 83338</h3>
<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be tough to discover and can also harm your home. Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are also a health risk and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and cause separations. Since the source of leaking water can be hard to discover, our plumbers typically perform a dye test to pinpoint the source. Commonly, pipes or water service lines are replaced, just to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not always unclean or stained and typically gets incorrect for a water system line leak.</p>
