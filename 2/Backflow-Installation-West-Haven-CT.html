<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive choice.</p>
<p>Repair leaky eves that could leak water onto the meter and freeze. Waste disposal unit systems work due to the fact that they shred food waste into pieces small enough to go through plumbing.
