<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
