I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.
