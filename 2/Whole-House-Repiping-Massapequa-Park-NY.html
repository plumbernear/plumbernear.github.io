<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
