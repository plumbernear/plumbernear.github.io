<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and combined with water. , if you prepare to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
