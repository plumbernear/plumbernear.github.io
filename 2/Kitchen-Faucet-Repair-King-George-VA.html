<h3>Frozen Pipes in King George Virginia</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have actually achieved a breakthrough in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) innovation. SACr physically eliminates temporary hardness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant constraints of present softening technologies.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
<p>The heating component is taking longer to heat up the water than it should if the water feels warm. But this specific issue is when you have no hot water streaming in your home. The reasons for this can vary from leaks, faulty or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat. If it is among the mentioned issues, a repair or replacement of the components may be sufficient. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place frequently, then a hot water heater replacement is essential.</p>
