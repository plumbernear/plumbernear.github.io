<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed.

<h3>High Pressure Hydro-Jetting in Harpers Ferry West Virginia</h2>
<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its typical flow. IRWD's safe and clean water system is created to keep the water streaming to you.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
