<p>If you see an odor or undesirable smell originating from your system, which is not uncommon, consider purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are easy and widely available to install, costing around $30 in the house enhancement or hardware stores. Turn off the water supply to your house at the main line.
