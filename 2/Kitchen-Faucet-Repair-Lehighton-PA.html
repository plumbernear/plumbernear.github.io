<p>Waste disposal unit are an essential part of any modern kitchen. A garbage disposal combines the ease of a sink with the utility of a trash can. Now you can just send all our larger food waste products into the garbage disposal and it will take care of the rest! In addition to a vast array of plumbing services, we concentrate on the installation and maintenance of garbage disposals and will gladly help you with whatever issues you are having.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
