<p>Spotty meals? Some underground rain gutter drains end in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your backyard. In that case, measure from the downspout to the nearby manhole, and use an auger line a minimum of that long to ensure you're cleaning the whole pipe. A garbage disposal will last 10 to 12-years, and the majority of service warranties cover the first 2 to 5-years. When purchasing a new system, keep this in mind.</p>
