<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and regular leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the more affordable and much better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
