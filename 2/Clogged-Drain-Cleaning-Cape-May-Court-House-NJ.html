<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water functions are considered a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place need to be indicated on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and then yearly.</p>
