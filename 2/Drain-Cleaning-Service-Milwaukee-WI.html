Leave the facilities immediately then call 911 and Atmos Energy at 866-322-8667. Do not rely on your sense of smell alone to detect the presence of gas.

<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Milwaukee WI</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
