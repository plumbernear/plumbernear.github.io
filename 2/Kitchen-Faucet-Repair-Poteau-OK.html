<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That means you have to cut off the protruding ends later with a hacksaw. However very first link the water line, flush the toilet a number of times and check for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut up until you've done these last checks lets you easily eliminate and reset the toilet if you discover any problems.</p>
