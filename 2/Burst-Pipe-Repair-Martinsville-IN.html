<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Martinsville IN 46151? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
