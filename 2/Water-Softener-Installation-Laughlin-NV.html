<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction. You might be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with moisture. While it does its job quite well, in time, it still does corrode. This enables the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically 2 layers of defense. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the structure, but closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect way. There are two different types of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are typically specified-- a reduced pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. Since they will be on a certification test, I discuss them only.</p>
