<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the clog, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
