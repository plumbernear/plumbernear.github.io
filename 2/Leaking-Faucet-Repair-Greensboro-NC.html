New assemblies need to be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in tough water can cause a bad odor and taste. It gets rid of the mineral material to produce odor free drinking water that tastes good when you add a water softener.</p>
