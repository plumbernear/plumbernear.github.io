<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Culver City CA 90230</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the clog, working further into where the blockage is happening.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI.

The thermal expansion requires to get away, for this reason the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. The force exerted by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the tank to break and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out.
