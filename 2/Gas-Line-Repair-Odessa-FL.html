<p>To connect a power cable to the brand-new system, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not needed for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
