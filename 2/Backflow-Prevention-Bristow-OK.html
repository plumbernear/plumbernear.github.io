<p>Decreased pressure zone assemblies (RPZ), likewise called minimized pressure principle assemblies, are the market standard for any kind of commercial home, including apartment buildings and condos, because they provide the greatest level of protection against pollutants and toxic substances. Lowered pressure zone assemblies are the most expensive and complicated backflow valves to install; however, when set up properly, these are the most safe and most reliable backflow valves readily available.

<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, a special kind of black pipe should be utilized that is covered with a special plastic material that keeps the moisture out.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent.

This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
