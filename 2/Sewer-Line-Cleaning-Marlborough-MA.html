<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Marlborough MA</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leaks. If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and much better long-lasting service.</p>
