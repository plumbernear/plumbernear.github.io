<p>Leak detection is a component of water preservation that relies on highly technical expertise and customized equipment to determine the area of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and pinpoint the area of those leaks at which visible water may or might not have actually appeared. Water temperature issues can be fixed by changing the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Property owners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method, water pressure can also be low.</p>
