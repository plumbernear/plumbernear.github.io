<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
