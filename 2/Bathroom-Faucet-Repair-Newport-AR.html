So-called tough" water is the result of ground water passing through and dissolving rocks and minerals, which then release calcium and magnesium ions. These dissolved ions offer hard water its characteristics.</p>
<p>You depend on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. Gradually, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them tough to get rid of.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Install screens over your drains to keep food and hair out of the pipes. Separate licenses are required for outside site energy work on a sanitary or storm sewer lateral.
