<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
<p>These are all signs that your unit must be examined by a plumber. We don't suggest attempting to repair this particular appliance by yourself, since it does present a safety risk, due to the sharp blades that are utilized to chop and grind waste. You should likewise prevent utilizing any kind of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal because these chemicals will just damage the appliance even more.</p>
