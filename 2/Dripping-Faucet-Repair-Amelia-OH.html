<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Amelia OH</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
