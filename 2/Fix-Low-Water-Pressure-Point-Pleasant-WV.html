While these are cost-efficient in the beginning buy, they are not the most effective or reliable way for you to get warm water, particularly if your unit is obsoleted. It may be time to consider changing it with a new energy-efficient design if your water heater is more than 8 years old. That's where the plumbers at Casteel is available in.</p>

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
