If you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting, you may have an idea of where your lateral lies. If you do not know, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, or even go into and break the line. If you are employing someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the locations to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to determine.</p>
