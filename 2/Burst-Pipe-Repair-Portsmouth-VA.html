<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
