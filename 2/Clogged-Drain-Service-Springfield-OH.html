This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline.

Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in tough water can cause a bad smell and taste. It gets rid of the mineral content to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes good when you add a water softener.</p>
<p>Deterioration: The most common issue is corrosion in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is particularly real if you have unattended hard water, which consists of extreme minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material with time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is triggering the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is challenging to repair. Leakages frequently mean a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
