The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the issue became worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey choice.</p>
<p>Check to ensure it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog.
