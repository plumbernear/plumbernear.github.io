<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Companies in Madison</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing company. Identify the size of the water pipes in the house and around the house - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines must be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the house. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to supply appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these little deposits are safe, however over time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
