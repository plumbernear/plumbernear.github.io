<p>Once a large enough source of water has actually been identified and evaluated, the third major part of a water supply system comes into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
