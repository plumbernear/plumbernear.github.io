<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience clogs in multiple drains at the same time in your house, then that usually means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in several places and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>You should notice the difference in your house's plumbing right away. The flow of water will come much easier from faucets and water pressure will improve. Regular monthly water expenses will improve also, and you can expect to need couple of to no repairs for leakages and obstructions throughout the next few years. With appropriate maintenance, your re-piping will last for lots of generations.</p>
