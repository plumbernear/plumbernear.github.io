<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
