<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
