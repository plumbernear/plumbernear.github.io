<p>In truth, reverse flow testing developed to make sure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011.

Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are effectively checked by qualified workers.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular event, but it does take place more frequently than you think! Often it takes place during the night when you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
