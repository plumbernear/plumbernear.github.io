<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair in Hot Springs Village AR 71909</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Common enough that many people choose do-it-yourself repairs. However often even recognizing the leak can be a problem. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were fantastic. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a substantial mess. They, as with everyone we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were polite, prompt, and really educated. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either big or little job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, sink, or bathtub) can be treated quickly if the clog is shallow and simple. For many blockages you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, however if this does not resolve the issue then you may also need to contact a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to assist. As a bathroom drain is likewise harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
