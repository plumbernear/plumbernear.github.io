Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
