<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the clog, working further into where the blockage is taking place.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion assists force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.

You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
