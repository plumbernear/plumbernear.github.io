<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles however will squander more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
