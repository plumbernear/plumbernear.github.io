<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
