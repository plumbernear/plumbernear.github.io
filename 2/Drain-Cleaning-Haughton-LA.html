<p>Maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from competent plumbing professionals when you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair. Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to stream in only one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, potable water can flow both in and out of a structure or component. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water in reverse into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement may stream in reverse into the potable water system. To protect water quality, backflow defense is needed where the end user presents a risk of contaminating the city's supply of water.</p>
