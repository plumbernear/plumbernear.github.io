<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
