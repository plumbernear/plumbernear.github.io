Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
