<h3>How To Pick Good 24 Hour Emergency Plumbers For Pipe Video Inspections Muscatine IA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
