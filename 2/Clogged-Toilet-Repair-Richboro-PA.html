<p>Setting up the new drain is a basic matter: First, create a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top.

I recently had to replace the water heater in my home and it was only 6 years old. Traditional hot water heater with a tank should normally last 10 to 15 years. I likewise have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been used in more than 2 years. Washing dishes is my least favorite task, especially without the help of a dishwasher.</p>
