<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Westlake Village CA 91361</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
