Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
