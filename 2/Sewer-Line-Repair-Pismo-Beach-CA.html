<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
