<p>When you have actually discovered the trip lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
