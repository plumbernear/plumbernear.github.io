<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Rosemead CA</h3>
<p>Think about all the locations water streams in and out of your house. These are the areas that a professional assessment must cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines should be covered. While your water heater and toilets will get unique attention, a skilled plumber looks to analyze the complete health of your system. That implies testing for proper water pressure. After all, too much pressure can damage your plumbing, and insufficient can leave your home with dysfunctional water appliances.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
