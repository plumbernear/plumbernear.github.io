<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Hixson TN 37343?</h3>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
