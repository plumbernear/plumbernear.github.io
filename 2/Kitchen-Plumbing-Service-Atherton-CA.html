<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that just original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
