<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to eliminate chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and ends up in our lakes and streams. In homes with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>First and foremost, never plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor near to your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your home to the city line.) You may have an idea of where your lateral is located if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not know, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, and even go into and break the line. If you are working with somebody to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also know the areas to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to recognize.</p>
