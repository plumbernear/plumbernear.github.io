<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is simple and cheap. However discovering the best washer might not be. The most common washers are typically readily available in your home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be difficult to discover.
