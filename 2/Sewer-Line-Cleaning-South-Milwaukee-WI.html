This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
