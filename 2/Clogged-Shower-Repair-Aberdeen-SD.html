<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Aberdeen SD</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Also note that backflow prevention is needed when required, along with inspection of the device to ensure it's working effectively. In Your Home Service Medical Professionals, our Sewerologists have years of sewer repair and replacement experience under our belts.
