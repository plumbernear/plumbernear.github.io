<p>Next, check the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale development or deterioration. It is essential that the repair specialist is delicate to the hardness and kind of the different coatings used on iron body units so as not to damage the protective finishing.</p>
