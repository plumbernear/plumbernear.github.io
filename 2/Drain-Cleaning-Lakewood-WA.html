<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
