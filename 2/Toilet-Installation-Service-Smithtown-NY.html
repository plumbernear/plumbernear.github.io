<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
