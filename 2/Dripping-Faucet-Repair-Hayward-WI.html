<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
