<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically salt or often potassium).</p>

I would certainly suggest them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>

The mold development would more than likely lag your walls however will begin to seep through gradually.
