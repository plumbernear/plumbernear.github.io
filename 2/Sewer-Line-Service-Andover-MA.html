<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Andover MA 01810</h3>
<p>You'll have to replace it if your old disposal is broken beyond repair. Although any broken device is frustrating to handle, the bright side is that setting up a replacement disposal will be more affordable than installing a new garbage disposal in a sink that has never had one before. Depending on the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the rate.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and reinstall locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>

Slow-draining or standing water is typically an indication of a clogged drain problem.
