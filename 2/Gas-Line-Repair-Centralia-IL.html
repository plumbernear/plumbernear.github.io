<h3>Drain Maintenance in Centralia Illinois</h2>
<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its regular circulation. IRWD's safe and clean water system is developed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "normal," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water getting in the drinkable water distribution system.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
