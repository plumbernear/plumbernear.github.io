The most popular and standard style of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's communities is a gas or electrical tank unit. These systems keep simply the correct amount of hot water for your convenience. If you are seeking to save more energy and lower your water expense, a tankless water heater would be best As you use it not when you don't because it just warms water.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
