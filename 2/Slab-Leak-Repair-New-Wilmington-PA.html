<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to many different kinds of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from deterioration and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your home.
