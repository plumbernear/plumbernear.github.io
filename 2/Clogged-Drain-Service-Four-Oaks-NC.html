<p>Blending vaporized salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this could clog the softening tank. It is recommended that you permit your unit to go empty of one type of salt before including another to prevent the event of any problems.

Limescale on pipes can cause deterioration and blockages, which not only reduces the life-span of the pipes but puts you in a position where you may need to pay for an expensive repair.

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>

<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
