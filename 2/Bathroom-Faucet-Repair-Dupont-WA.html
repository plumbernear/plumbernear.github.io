<p>The kitchen is, probably, the most essential room in your home. This is where your family prepares food and gathers together for meal times.

Such packages direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the place of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet set.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
