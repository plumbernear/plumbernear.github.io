<p>Drains, drains and waste piping are checked for appropriate grading to preserve down circulation. The plumbing system is checked for leaks. We examine that the material utilized in the plumbing system is authorized by an acknowledged testing laboratory. We forbid cross connections in between safe water and water from a doubtful source and prohibit the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We also examine the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
