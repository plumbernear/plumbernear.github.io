A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely cracked and merely needs to be replaced.</p>
