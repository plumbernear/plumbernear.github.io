<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various types of corrosion.

This might not need totally repiping the house, considering that newer materials might have already been utilized in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you determine precisely what work requires to be done.</p>
