<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Usually, minerals get there because groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water until it is in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to get rid of liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers hard water.</p>
