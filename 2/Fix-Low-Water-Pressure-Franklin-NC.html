<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
