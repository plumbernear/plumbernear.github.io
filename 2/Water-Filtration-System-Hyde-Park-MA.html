It's easy to forget your hot water heater until there's an issue since these devices are typically out of sight and out of mind. Nevertheless, if you observe any of these problems, you should give your local, relied on plumber a call.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense might remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the new heater.</p>
