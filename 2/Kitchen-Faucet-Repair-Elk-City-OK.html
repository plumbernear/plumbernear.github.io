<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater replacement, maintenance or repair, you can expect professional service from experienced plumbing professionals. Backflow prevention gadgets operate by allowing water to stream in only one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a structure or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water in reverse into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the safe and clean water supply.
