Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
