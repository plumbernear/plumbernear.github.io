In structures aside from Group R-3 tenancies, a license and inspection will be required for more substantial work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor wing, area, or level is included, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (small) of the overall building plumbing.</p>
