<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that must likewise be well maintained to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and crack or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever remains in great shape.</p>
