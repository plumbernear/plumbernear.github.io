<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can actually be the cheaper and much better long-term option if you do have regular leaks.</p>
