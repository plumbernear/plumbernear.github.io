<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the structure authorization.
