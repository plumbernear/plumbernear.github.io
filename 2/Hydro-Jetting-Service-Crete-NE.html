And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>

These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
