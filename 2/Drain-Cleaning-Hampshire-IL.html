<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in Hampshire IL 60140</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
