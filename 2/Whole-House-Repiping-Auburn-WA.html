The pre-programmed number represents the quantity of time in between each regeneration. For instance, a lower selected number indicates your softener will restore less often. If you are experiencing stains, attempt picking a lower number up until you discover one that fulfills your needs. Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and efficient than time-initiated softeners.</p>
