Gradually, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
