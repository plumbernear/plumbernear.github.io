<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience blockages in multiple drains at the same time in your home, then that usually means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
