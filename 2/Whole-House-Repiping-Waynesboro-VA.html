<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>Why it's fantastic: Families with little kids will discover batch feed garbage disposals much safer, given that they will not run without the drain cover and can't be switched on by flipping a switch.
