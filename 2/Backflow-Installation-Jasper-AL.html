<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
