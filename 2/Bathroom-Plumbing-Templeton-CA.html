You may be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, however without the zinc coating. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its job quite well, in time, it still does rust. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
