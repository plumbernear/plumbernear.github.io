<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
