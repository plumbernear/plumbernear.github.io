<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
