<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Garbage disposal clogged or broken? Whether you need repairs or replacement, we've got you covered in the Cincinnati area. Garbage disposals are created to work in one of two methods. Either through what's known as a batch feed, where the system is filled, then covered before it is turned on, or through a constant feed, where the system can be filled while it is running.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit fixes all of those problems, adding convenience. Just turn on water at the garbage and the sink disposal does the rest - and far more silently than you believe. By crushing food waste-- modern-day waste disposal unit do not actually utilize blades - it's processed by water treatment centers where the small particulates are easily strained and developed into solid fertilizer, which, in turn, can be offered to decrease the general costs of treatment.</p>

To repair your pipes, we use remote cameras to check and determine the source of the problem quickly and effectively. From buildups and obstructions to getting into root systems from your landscaping, we provide drain repairs that will last.</p>
