<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
