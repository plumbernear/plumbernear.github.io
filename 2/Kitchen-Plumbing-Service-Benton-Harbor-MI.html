You might have an idea of where your lateral is located if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, spend the minimal cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or even go into and break the line. If you are working with somebody to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also understand the locations to prevent. If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to recognize.</p>
