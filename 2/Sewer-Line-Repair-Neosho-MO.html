<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
