<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Lancaster PA 17603</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
