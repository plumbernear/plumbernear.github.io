<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
