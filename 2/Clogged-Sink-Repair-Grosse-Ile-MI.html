<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a correctly operating RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage must also be offered.</p>
