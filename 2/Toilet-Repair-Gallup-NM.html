A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the property owner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
