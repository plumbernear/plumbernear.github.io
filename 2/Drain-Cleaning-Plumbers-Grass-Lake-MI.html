<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exemptions in Section 106.2.2 will apply to minor repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings aside from Group R-3 tenancies, an authorization and inspection will be needed for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor area, level, or wing is included, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (nominal) of the total building plumbing.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
