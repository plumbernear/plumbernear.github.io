<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try at West Chester OH 45069</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
