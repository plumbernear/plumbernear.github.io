While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can manage nearly any type of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the risk of drain blockages.</p>
