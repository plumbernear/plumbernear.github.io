<p>A newly installed hot water heater ought to not produce weird noises, however it will start to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things worsen significantly for families with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. A water heater replacement might be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we continue with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly includes an inlet and outlet turned off, appropriately situated test cocks, and the necessary components of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet).

A component can further be broken down into its private parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make components, and components are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
