<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
