Frequent blockages, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, could show an issue with the disposal.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
