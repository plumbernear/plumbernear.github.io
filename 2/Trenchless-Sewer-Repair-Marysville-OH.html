This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Before setting up, your professional will switch off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its mount. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
