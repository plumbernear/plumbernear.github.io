<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly should then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that could result in false data on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to extreme pressure spikes that might damage elements. The effects of raised temperature can likewise cause excessive pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the components. These and other negative results from the hydraulic conditions must be acknowledged and their cause fixed. If parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected, the new parts can quickly be made inoperative.</p>

It is important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts.
