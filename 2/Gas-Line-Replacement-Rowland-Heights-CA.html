<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the exact same thing, but without the zinc finishing. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is indicated to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its task pretty well, in time, it still does rust. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>In a hectic household, a clogged bathtub drain can become a substantial issue over night. Soap, hair, animal fur, and even bath toys can add to clogged bathtub drains. With the correct plunger or drain snake, it's possible to unclog a bathtub drain by yourself.

<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the safe and clean supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up.
