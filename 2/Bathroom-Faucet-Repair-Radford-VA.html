<p>This article intends to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive. Here are a couple of complicated truths that often lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is generally destructive. Therefore, softened water must likewise be destructive, right? This is a fallacy because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had a number of plumbing leaks fixed and couldn't be happier with the timely service I got from Parker and Sons. They are extremely experienced, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely suggest them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or long-term connection in between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
