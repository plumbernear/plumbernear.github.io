Hydro-jetting is an advanced kind of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to completely clean out whatever inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and eliminate the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and remove wire connectors. Detach garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp adapter and eliminate wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise till the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
