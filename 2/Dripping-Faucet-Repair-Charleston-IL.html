<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
