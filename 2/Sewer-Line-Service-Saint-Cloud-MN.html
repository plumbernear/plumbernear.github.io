<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
