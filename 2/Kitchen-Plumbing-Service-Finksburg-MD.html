<p>When you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
