In an unprotected water service connection, drinkable water can stream both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from automobile washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the drinkable water system.
