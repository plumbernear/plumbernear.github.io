Backflow prevention devices run by permitting water to stream in only one instructions. In an unprotected water service connection, drinkable water can stream both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from automobile washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the drinkable water system. To secure water quality, backflow protection is required where the end user positions a risk of contaminating the city's water supply.</p>

<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
