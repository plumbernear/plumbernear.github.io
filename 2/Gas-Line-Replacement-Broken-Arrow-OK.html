Getting a plumbing contractor's license might be easy, but being discovered and growing your service is yet another story. Arm yourself with the right understanding if you want to be effective.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure.

If it's mostly yellow, or if it's sooty under there, your flue may be clogged, which is an unsafe scenario. Contact a professional to inspect it out.
