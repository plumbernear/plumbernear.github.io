<p>A recently installed water heater should not produce strange sounds, however it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to warm the water. Things intensify drastically for families with a high need for hot water.

A water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.
