<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Adamsville AL</h3>
<p>Garbage disposals are a crucial part of any modern kitchen. A waste disposal unit combines the ease of a sink with the utility of a trash bin.

Together with a large range of plumbing services, we focus on the installation and maintenance of garbage disposals and will happily assist you with whatever problems you are having.</p>

If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

<h3>You Can Save Money With Water Leak Detection in Adamsville AL 35005</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>But is a plumbing catastrophe impending or just a concern for the distant future?
