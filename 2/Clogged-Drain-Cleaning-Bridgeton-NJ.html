<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
