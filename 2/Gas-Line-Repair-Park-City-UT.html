<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and blended with water. , if you plan to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>

Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
