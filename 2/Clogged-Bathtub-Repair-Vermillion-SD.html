<p>As a locally-owned company, stability and responsibility are extremely crucial to constructing a credibility for excellence. When is related to Garbage Disposals installation, it is highly suggested not to try any DIY.

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
