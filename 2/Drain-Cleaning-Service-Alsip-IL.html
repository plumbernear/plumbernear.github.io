<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4.

Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
