Basic repairs need no specific tools or devices and do not take a long period of time. Replacement parts are easily available at your local house enhancement store. The most common tools required are a cordless drill, hacksaw, hammer drill, and locking pliers.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.
