They should be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only secure against back siphonage.</p>
<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating effect on your company.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
