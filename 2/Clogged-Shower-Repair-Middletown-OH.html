<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or broken, it might wreak undesirable issues on your residential or commercial property. A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.
