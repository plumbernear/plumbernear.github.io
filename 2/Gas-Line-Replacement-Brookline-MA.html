<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be hard to detect and can likewise damage your property. Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are likewise a health risk and frequently go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and trigger separations.

This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
