<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our stiff trust certification standards.

Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the whole component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
