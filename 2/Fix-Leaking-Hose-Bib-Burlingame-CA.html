<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Burlingame CA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet much easier, brand-new toilet bolts are additional long. That indicates you need to cut off the protruding ends later on with a hacksaw. But first link the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and check for leakages. Leaving the bolts uncut up until you've done these last checks lets you quickly reset the toilet and eliminate if you discover any problems.</p>
