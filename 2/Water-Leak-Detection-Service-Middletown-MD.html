<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable option, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
