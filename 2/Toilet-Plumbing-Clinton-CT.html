<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
<p>The average time to replace a garbage or install disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.
