<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
