<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt.

Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
