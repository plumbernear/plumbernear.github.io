When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is broken. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed in time.

A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is likely cracked and merely needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
