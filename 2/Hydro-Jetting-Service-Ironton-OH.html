A conventional tank hot water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before requiring a replacement, while a tankless water heater can last up to 20 with correct maintenance and care.

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
