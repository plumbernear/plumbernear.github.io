<p>Tankless electrical water heaters come in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are big and powerful enough to supply warm water to all bathrooms, kitchen areas, and home appliances in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that provide warm water to specific rooms or devices only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the very same method. The only distinction is the quantity of water they can warm up at any offered time. Also, whole-house systems are substantially more costly than the point of usage systems.</p>
