<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to many different types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from deterioration and might put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your house.
