<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
