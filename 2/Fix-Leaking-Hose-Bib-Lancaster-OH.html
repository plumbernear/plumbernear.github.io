No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does occur more often than you believe! Often it takes place during the night when you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
