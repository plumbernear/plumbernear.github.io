<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Anadarko OK 73005</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that should also be well kept to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and split or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so used or rusty that they spring a leak.
