However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
