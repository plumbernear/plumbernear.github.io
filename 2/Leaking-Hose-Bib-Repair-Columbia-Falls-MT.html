<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
