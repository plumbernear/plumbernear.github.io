<p>Likewise, if you have a 2-story home, it'll be more expensive to repipe since the plumber will have to browse through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a huge job - and it's a task you wish to get right. However the range of plumbing pipe materials to select from can make it confusing.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
<p>It is essential that you attend to any and all problems that you discover in the house's plumbing system (or in other places in the home, for that matter) with the seller or real estate agent prior to making an offer or closing the sale.
