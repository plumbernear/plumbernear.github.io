<p>Looking to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Numerous clogs are caused by putting excessive toilet paper into the bowl. Understand how much toilet tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never place any paper item into the toilet bowl aside from toilet tissue. Paper towels can quickly stop up the toilet drain line or cause a clog even more down the drainpipe. Womanly hygiene items must be dealt with in the trash and never ever in the toilet.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This average lifespan calculation assumes typical wear and tear of the unit.
