Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get changed when repiped.</p>
<p>Distribution pipes transition to even smaller sized private service pipes, bring water to private homes, apartment stores, companies and structures. Depending on need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water gets in the consumer center through a water meter that records circulation rates and water usage for billing functions. Private service pipelines are normally made from type, plastic or lead K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>
