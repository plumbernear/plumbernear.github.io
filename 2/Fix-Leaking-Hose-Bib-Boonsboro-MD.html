<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Boonsboro MD 21713</h3>
<p>Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new hot water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed properly. A water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in large, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
