<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Corydon IN 47112</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
