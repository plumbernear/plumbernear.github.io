<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that relies on extremely technical competence and specialized devices to determine the place of leaks throughout the city's water circulation system and pinpoint the location of those leakages at which noticeable water might or might not have emerged. Water temperature problems can be fixed by changing the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic ways of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow.
