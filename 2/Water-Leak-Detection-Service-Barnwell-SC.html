<p>A newly set up water heater should not produce odd noises, but it will start to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things get worse dramatically for households with a high need for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
