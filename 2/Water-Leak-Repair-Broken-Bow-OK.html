<p>It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should also be provided.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we continue with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet turned off, appropriately located test dicks, and the required components of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each element can even more be broken down into its parts. For instance a first check is a component. An element can even more be broken down into its specific parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make elements, and elements are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
