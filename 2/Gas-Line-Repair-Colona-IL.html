<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Colona IL 61241</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day.
