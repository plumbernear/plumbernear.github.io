<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
