<h3>Clogged Drain in Big Rapids Michigan</h2>
<p>Is your drain clogged with hair, toilet, or debris paper? After years of use, drains can collect damaging accumulation. This build-up obstructs water flow, eventually backing up your drains till they are unusable. Typically, all the pipes need is a good scrubbing. We can achieve this through a variety of approaches such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The most convenient solution might appear to be merely neglecting the issue or utilizing a do it yourself chemical option. Nevertheless, this is a short-lived fix and might trigger more damage. Some pipe products, like copper or cast-iron, are delicate to chemicals. Chemical cleaners can rust and deteriorate your pipes, causing significant leakages, cracks, and big damages.</p>

<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in Big Rapids MI 49307?</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
