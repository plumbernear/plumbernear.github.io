<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our stiff trust certification standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal rust, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and corroded parts make repairs pricey and hard, indicating a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the right fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>

Structures that do not abide by local code are considered unsafe and need an upgrade. In severe cases, it's much better to demolish old structures rather of investing the time and cash on costly repairs or replacements.</p>
