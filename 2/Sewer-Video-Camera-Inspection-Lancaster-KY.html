Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
