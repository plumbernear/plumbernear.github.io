<p>The majority of demand for plumbers will come from brand-new construction and the need to keep and repair plumbing systems in existing homes and other structures. Employment of sprinklerfitters is anticipated to increase as states continue to embrace changes to constructing codes that need the use of fire suppression systems. It's most likely that the new system will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal attached to the sink currently. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. Many drains are attached to the sink by a big nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
