<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Rosedale NY</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Another method to handle a clog is by using a chemical cleaning item or if you fear they might be too extreme on your pipes, you can try old home remedies like hot water, vinegar, and baking soda. If you have actually tried everything and the clog stays, call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and ask about our clogged toilet repair service.
