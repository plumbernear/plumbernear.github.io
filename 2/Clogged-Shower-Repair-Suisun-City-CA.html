<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

As piping installation and repair specialists, we can fix problems or explain when it will be more secure or more cost-efficient to just redo your piping system. Thanks to this type of regeneration, the waste water contains the right ratio of compounds that were soaked up throughout the softening process. The wastewater is a carbonated "mineral water" of drinking water quality that is free of solids.</p>
