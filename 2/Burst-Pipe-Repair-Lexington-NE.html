<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
