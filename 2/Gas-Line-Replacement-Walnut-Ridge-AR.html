<p>A lot of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
