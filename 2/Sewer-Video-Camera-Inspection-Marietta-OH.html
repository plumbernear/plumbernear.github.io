While chemical drain cleaners may be a low-cost service, the severe components rust your inner drain pipe, with time, developing weak points in the pipe that are likely to rupture. Handling fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may need somewhat various steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
