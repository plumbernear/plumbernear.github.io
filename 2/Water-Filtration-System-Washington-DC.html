<p>Every sensible buyer examines at least a number of things prior to making a down payment on a home. As you might be aware that the water quality here is quite bad. But are you mindful just how bad? The majority of the Valley in fact has a few of the worst water in the country. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the nation according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do reside in a desert after all. In truth the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even consume has a chlorine level that is ideal for swimming pools. We have 300% more chemicals that surpass national health standards, and a even high percentage of toxins in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our typical water hardness level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity reasons "very tough water".</p>
<p>Provided there isn't a tank failure, typically a commercial water heater can be fixed, but is it worth fixing? Just after answering the following questions should you respond to repair or replace. Do you know the number of years old your water heater is? Do you understand the number of years it's ranked for? Think about replacement instead of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was rated for.</p>
