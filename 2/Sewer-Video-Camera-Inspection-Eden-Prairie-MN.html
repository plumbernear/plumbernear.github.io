<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
