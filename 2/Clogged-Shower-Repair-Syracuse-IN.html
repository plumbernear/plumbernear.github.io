<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
