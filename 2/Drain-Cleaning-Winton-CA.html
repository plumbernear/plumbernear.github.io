<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode.

As the outer finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
