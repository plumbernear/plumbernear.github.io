<h3>Unclog Drain in Poughkeepsie New York</h2>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to several types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from corrosion and may place toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your home. This may not need completely repiping your house, given that more recent materials might have currently been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you determine exactly what work requires to be done.</p>
