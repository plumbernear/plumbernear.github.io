If your plumber requires a license to repair the gas leak, which they'll probably have to carry out in the Atlanta metro area, the costs to pull the authorization will add to your repair cost.

<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters must have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Suggestion: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the inside. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible option.</p>
