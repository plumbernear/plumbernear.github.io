Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of large cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>
