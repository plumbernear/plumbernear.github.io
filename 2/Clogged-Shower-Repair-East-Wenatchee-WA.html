<p>Building codes can vary from city to city, however all serve the very same function. The substantial list of provisions and rules note the minimum requirements for the design and building and construction of a commercial or residential structure. Structures that do not adhere to local code are considered hazardous and need an update. In serious cases, it's much better to destroy old structures instead of spending the time and cash on costly repairs or replacements.</p>

<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water supply within a structure these gadgets are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no way to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the building authorization. Inspections should be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will release an offense notification, and a specific time period is allocated to fix the problem.</p>
