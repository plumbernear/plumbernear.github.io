<p>As soon as a large enough source of water has actually been determined and examined, the 3rd major part of a supply of water system comes into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these primary long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most large cities need several aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically apart sources.</p>
