<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the option with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
