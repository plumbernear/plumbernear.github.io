<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Ward AR 72176</h3>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>
