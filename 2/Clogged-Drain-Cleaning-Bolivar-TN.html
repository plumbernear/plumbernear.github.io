<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

If you do not understand, spend the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, or even go into and break the line. If you are employing somebody to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also understand the locations to avoid.
