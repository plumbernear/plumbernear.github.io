<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
