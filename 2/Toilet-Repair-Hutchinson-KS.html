However are you conscious simply how bad? Most of the Valley in reality has some of the worst water in the nation. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the nation according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do live in a desert after all.

We have 300% more chemicals that exceed national health standards, and a even high percentage of toxins in our water that the national average. On top of that our average water hardness level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity factors "really tough water".</p>
