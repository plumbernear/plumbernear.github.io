<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No warm water in your home? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement.

<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Objects such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become trapped in between your drainpipe and your pipes.

You may be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this part breakdowns.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
