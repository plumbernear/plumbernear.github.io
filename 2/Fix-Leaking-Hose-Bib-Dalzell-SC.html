<h3>Leaky Faucets in Dalzell SC 29040 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>Doctor Fix-It is Denver's source for a professional toilet repair or replacement service. The whole house has polybutylene plumbing. This is a kind of plastic resin that was extensively utilized by home builders for houses integrated in the 1970s through the 1990s. The problem with this type of plastic piping is it can end up being breakable and break easily, especially if your water is chlorinated or chemically treated.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
