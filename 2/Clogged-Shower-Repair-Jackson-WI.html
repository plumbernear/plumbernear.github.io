<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over years.

After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from rust and might place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your home. This might not need completely repiping your home, since more recent products might have currently been used in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing.
