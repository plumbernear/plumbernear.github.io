<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Unless you have firsthand experience in the plumbing industry, allow a professional to manage the installation. We'll send an experienced technician to your house when you call Pratt Plumbing. She or he will treat you with the utmost regard and courtesy. They'll answer any concerns you have and provide advice on the appropriate usage of a disposal system.</p>
