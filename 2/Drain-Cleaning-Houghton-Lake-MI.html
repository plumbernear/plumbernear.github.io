Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terms before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair.

Backflow parts are assembled to make elements, and components are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
