<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Auburn IN</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the help of a professional. Some minor blockages can be taken care of with a plunger and frequently, when the toilet won't stop running, it's an easy matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, certain problems do call for a trained plumber, and it is essential to know the difference to prevent lost money, frustration, and time.</p>
