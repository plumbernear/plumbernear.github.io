<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems require backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be gotten rid of. Backflow assemblies are required to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape lawn sprinkler. The law likewise requires backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as medical facilities and mortuaries, along with commercial centers.</p>
