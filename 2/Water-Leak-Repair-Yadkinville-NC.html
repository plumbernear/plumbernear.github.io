Worn out and corroded parts make repairs tough and costly, meaning a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the appropriate fix for issues such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
