<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
