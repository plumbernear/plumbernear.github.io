<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does.

No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does take place more frequently than you think! When you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
