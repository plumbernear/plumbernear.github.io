<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
