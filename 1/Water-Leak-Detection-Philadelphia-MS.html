<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based on polymer type components such as sodium polycarboxylate. Faulty Components: If your toilet won't stop running, it's likely due to problems with a toilet tank element. In such cases, we are typically able to replace that single component.

<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
