<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Bardstown KY</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>If you have a large bathtub or more that 2 restrooms, this design water heater might make the most sense for you. There are some installation factors to consider, especially around sizing the gas line and installing the flue vent, but with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to produce more warm water than a basic 80-gallon tank, these things are pretty unique. High-efficiency storage is a great choice for space heating hydronic choices too.</p>
