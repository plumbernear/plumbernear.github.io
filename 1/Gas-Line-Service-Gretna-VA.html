<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The Minor Label Program is an alternative inspection program established by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). The program utilizes small installation labels and random inspections instead of routine electrical and plumbing authorizations for certain types of small electrical and plumbing work. Your backflow preventer stopped working inspection due to extreme vegetation. Please trim your plants and arrange for testing with a company from our certified tester list This must be completed within thirty days to avoid water service disruption.</p>
