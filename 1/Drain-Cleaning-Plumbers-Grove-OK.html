<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Grove OK 74344</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it actually presses into the clog, working further into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
