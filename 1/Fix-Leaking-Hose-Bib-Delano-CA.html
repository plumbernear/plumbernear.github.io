From getting a brand-new water heater when I first moved in, to appearing at 10pm due to the fact that a pipe busted in my tub and I had water leaking through my lighting fixtures. These men are genuinely the best. Terrific prices, everyone I have had the enjoyment of dealing with has been so kind and responsive also I highly recommend utilizing their services.</p>

I just recently needed to replace the hot water heater in my house and it was just 6 years old. Traditional water heaters with a tank should typically last 10 to 15 years.

<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
