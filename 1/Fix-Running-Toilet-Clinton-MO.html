<p>Tough water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex scientific process, but easy to treat. It utilizes salt to eliminate minerals and odors discovered in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and bring in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
