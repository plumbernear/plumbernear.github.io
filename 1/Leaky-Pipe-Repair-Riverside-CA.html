<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly working RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be provided.</p>
<p>In cold environments, soil, waste or water pipes must not be installed outside of a home, in exterior walls, in attics, or crawlspaces, or in another other place subjected to freezing temperature unless some arrangements are made to secure it from freezing by insulation or heat.
