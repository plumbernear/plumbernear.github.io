You may have sediment that has developed up in the system and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting adequate hot water for your shower. If your water heater isn't doing its only task, it's time to seek advice from the specialists.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might need somewhat different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll locate among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
