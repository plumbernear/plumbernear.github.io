To make it soft, you have to get rid of the minerals. That's the main difference between soft and tough water The existence of the minerals in the water can reveal itself in a range of ways.</p>
<h3>Water Softeners & Filters in Ridgefield Washington</h2>
<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to remove chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In homes with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
