<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat various actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but opportunities are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
