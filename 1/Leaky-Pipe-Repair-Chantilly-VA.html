<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more pricey to repipe because the plumber will have to navigate through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a big job - and it's a task you want to get right. However the series of plumbing pipe products to choose from can make it complicated.

There is a leak someplace and this could be major problem if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house must have water. This chooses every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to an excellent start if everything is working properly.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
