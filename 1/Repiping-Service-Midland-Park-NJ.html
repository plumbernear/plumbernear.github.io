<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the degree of the rot.

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
