<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Norman OK</h3>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is called fouling. Sometimes it may be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin ends up being fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to maker guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be tough to repair as they are generally situated behind the sink, in cramped areas. The very best method to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches use up too much area and need a broad swing angle, which may be hard to get in small spaces.</p>
