The steps for replacing a propane hot water heater are exactly the very same, and those for an electrical hot water heater are comparable. Repeating leakages and repairs. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we recommend changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
