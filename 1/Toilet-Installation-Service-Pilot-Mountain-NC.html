<h3>Sewer Line Repair & Replacement in Pilot Mountain North Carolina</h2>
<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll start to damage from rust and might place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest replacing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your home. This may not require completely repiping your home, given that newer products might have currently been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing.

In a lot of cases, elimination will only add an extra $25 to $50 to the total costs, but in some cases the costs could be higher if additional pipes must also be changed.</p>
