<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
