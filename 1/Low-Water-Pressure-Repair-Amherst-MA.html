<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Amherst MA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Prior to any drain cleaning company in Atlanta, GA, we will perform a camera inspection. These inspections are a necessary step in identifying which service will match you best.
