<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs might be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater.</p>
