<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our stiff trust certification requirements. A great general rule is to replace faucets that reveal corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and wore away parts make repairs tough and expensive, implying a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for problems such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the whole component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
