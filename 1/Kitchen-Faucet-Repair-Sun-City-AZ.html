When the FutureSoft water softener is installed, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This does not indicate it's not working.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
