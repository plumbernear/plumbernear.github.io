<p>In water system systems, water is normally maintained at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might stop working or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
