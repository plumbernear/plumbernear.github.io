<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The highly toxic insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company worker had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external house hose bibb (outdoors spigot).

<p>Considering that 1980, backflow preventers have actually been lawfully mandated for specific buildings by the New york city Sanitary Code and the Rules of the City of New York.

<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and changed with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only initial factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
