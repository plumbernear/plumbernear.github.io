<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Service in Covington</h2>

<p>Your disposer might come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as laid out below. Both will develop a good seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
