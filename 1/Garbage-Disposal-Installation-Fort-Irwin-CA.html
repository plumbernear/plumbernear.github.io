<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 different celebrations, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess. They, as with each person we've encountered with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and very well-informed. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either big or little job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of firmness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
