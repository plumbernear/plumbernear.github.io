<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular event, but it does happen more frequently than you believe! When you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Quit working orders shall be used to halt work that is determined to be contrary to provisions of the Uniform Code, or is being conducted in a hazardous or unsafe manner, or is being performed without acquiring a needed permit. A stop work order shall specify the factor for its issuance and the conditions which need to be satisfied before work will be allowed to resume.</p>
