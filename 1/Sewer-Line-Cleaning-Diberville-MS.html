<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Sinkholes don't only happen in your backyard, unfortunately, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to find out quickly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running underneath your house's foundation.

In this case, you'll need professional plumbers in addition to foundation repair professionals.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
