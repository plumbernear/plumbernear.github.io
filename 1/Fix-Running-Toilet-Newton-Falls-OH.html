<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing service. Identify the size of the pipes in the home and around the house - they will help to determine the water pressure that you'll have.

The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in size to offer appropriate flow.</p>
<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are checked for correct grading to maintain downward circulation. The plumbing system is evaluated for leaks. We examine that the material used in the plumbing system is authorized by an acknowledged testing laboratory. We prohibit cross connections between safe water and water from a questionable source and prohibit the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We also inspect the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
