<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Mount Rainier MD</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet much easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That suggests you need to cut off the extending ends later on with a hacksaw. However very first connect the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and look for leakages. If you discover any problems, leaving the bolts uncut up until you've done these final checks lets you quickly reset the toilet and get rid of.</p>
