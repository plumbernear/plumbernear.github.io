<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Baldwin City KS 66006</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
