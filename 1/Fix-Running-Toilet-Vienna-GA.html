<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
