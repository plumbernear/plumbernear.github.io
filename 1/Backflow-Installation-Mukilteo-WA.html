<p>Find the right water softener for you. One common method for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem might spread exponentially. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in individual houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and infecting the public water system.</p>
<p>Another obligation of the Plumbing Department is to perform cross connection inspections to identify drinkable water supply that are in need of being protected from contaminates. The cross connection control program is needed by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399. A-Tex Plumbing will assist with any sort of emergency toilet repair, drain cleaning or replacement that you might need in your home or workplace.</p>
