<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Warning: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Even if copper is showing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes. You may have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>To eliminate the smells, initially attempt pouring BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a few minutes, run warm water down the drain. Insufficient or inaccessible cleanouts: No matter how reliable a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged eventually. Homeowners and plumbers need to be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this occurs. Buildings without adequate cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at threat of a pipe bursting.</p>
