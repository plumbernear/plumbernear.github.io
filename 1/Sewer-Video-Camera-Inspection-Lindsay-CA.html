We are now all set to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the elements to be eliminated in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Lots of components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each part is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the correct area. It is likewise crucial that as they are placed back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the elements or unintentionally put in the body. The components need to be positioned so that the guides have the ability to preserve their designed tolerances.</p>
