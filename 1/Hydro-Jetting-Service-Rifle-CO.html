<p>Hot water heater can be a costly financial investment for property owners that they cope with for over a decade. That's why when it's time to equip your brand-new house or replace your old water heater, it is necessary to think about the cost, effectiveness, and durability of a new system. Plumbers usually charge $45 to $65 an hour and can typically install a hot water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
