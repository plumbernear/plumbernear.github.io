As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
