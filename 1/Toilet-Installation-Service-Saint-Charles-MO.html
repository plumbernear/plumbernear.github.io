<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Saint Charles MO</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
