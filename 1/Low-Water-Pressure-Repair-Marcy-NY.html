<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing business.

The pipes themselves must be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Reduced to TAC, this method uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where firmness mineral ions are become a stable crystalline type that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are tiny and flow generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regrowth.</p>
