<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>A freshly installed water heater should not produce strange noises, however it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things aggravate drastically for households with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your house? Water pressure in the home resembles high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy.
