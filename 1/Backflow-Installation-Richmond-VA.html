<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Richmond VA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
