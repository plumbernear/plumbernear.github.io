<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
