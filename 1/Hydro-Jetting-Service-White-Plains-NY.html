<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a terrible effect on your service. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience far more use and tear than residential sewage systems and are more vulnerable to obstructions and clog. All backflow preventers need to be tested every year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to us.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does happen regularly than you believe! Typically it occurs at night when you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Within commercial facilities, DCV and RPZ backflow prevention systems should be inspected, kept, and tested with regularity. Without constant testing and servicing, these systems can permit polluted water to stream freely within your supply pipes, developing a serious health risk to building occupants. Each backflow prevention system requires various testing procedures and periods, and demands considerable experience and knowledge.</p>
