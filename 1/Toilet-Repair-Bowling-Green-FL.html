<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Bowling Green FL</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
