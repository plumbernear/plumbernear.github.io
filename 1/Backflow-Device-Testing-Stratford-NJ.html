<p>Culpeper Home Services offers professional waste disposal unit solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will provide you with choices for repair or replacement and suggest the best service depending on your specific requirements. For double-bowl sinks, the best way to tackle things is to use a constant waste disposer set consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such packages direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the place of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet set.</p>
