<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener.

As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
