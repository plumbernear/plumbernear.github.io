<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

We called on Ron Steele Plumbing to install new water supply and drain lines during our master bathroom redesigning project. Not only were they really affordable, but the professional service and quality installation surpassed our expectations.</p>
