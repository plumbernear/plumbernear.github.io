If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be needed.</p>
<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unneeded blockages even more down the water lines.
