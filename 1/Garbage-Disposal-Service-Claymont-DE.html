<p>Looking to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Lots of clogs are triggered by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Know how much toilet tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever place any paper product into the toilet bowl besides bathroom tissue.

<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain.
