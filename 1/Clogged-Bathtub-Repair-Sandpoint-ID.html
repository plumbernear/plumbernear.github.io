<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
