<p>The secret to the technology is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
