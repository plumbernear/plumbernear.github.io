<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Saint Amant LA</h3>
<p>When you consider a plumber, what's the very first thing that comes to mind? For many people, it's toilets. (Lucky us, right?)

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Saint Amant LA 70774!</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
