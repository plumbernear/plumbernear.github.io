In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to decrease any scale development or corrosion.

<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
