<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.
