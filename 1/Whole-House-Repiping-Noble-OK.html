<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Noble OK</h3>
<p>In the 1990 ′ s, dry spell conditions inspired water service providers to implement water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs.

This is a misconception since naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
