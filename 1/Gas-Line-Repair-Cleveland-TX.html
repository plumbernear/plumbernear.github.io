Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it really pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
