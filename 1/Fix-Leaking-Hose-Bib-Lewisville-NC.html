<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can develop noise. If your energy bills are increasing, a brand-new, greater efficiency water heater can bring them back down.

After that the softener can be detached, relocated to its new location and positioned there.</p>

The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
