If you aren't getting enough warm water for your shower, then you may have sediment that has actually developed in the unit and separated the water from the heat source. If your hot water heater isn't doing its only job, it's time to seek advice from the experts.</p>

However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
