<p>Hydro-jetting is a method of getting rid of build up and debris in tanks and lines by utilizing extremely high-pressure water to get rid of clogs. These clogs could have been made from grease, heavy sludge, or tree roots that have actually developed with time. Hydro jetting's innovative technology enables the procedure to be effective and fast. Since it can be unsafe if done by somebody with no training or experience, this process needs to be done by licensed plumbers.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Installing the new drain is a basic matter: First, develop a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top. Then install the top half of the drain from the top, and screw the nut and mounting bracket on from below. Make certain to eliminate any excess plumber's putty using a putty knife.
