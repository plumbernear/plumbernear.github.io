<p>Backflow preventers are also required by the plumbing code. Other than within Shoreline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities consumers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County).

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The area under your kitchen sink has actually gotten more crowded for many years. Initially, there would have been a cold and hot water line increasing to the faucet (normally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Utilizing liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless service technicians can treat in-place whole new areas of pipe within your damaged line, by means of little or perhaps pre-existing entry points.</p>
