<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, bathtub, or sink) can be treated quickly if the clog is simple and shallow. For a lot of blockages you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, but if this doesn't solve the issue then you may also need to employ a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to assist. As a bathroom drain is likewise harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
