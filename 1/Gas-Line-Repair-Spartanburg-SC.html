<p>The average time to replace a garbage or install disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
