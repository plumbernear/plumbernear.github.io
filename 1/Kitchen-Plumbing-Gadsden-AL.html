<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical service, particularly when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
