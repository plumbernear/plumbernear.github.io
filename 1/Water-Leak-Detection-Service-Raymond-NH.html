<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you have actually found the trip lever you want remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method. When you've secured the journey lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
