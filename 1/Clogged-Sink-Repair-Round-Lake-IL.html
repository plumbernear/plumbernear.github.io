<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Round Lake IL 60073?</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
