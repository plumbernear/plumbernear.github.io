For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and break or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
