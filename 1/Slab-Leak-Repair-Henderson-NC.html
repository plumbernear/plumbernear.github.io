<p>The following information is intended to provide some guidance regarding hiring of contractors and installation of plumbing and gas piping. Hiring an unregistered contractor or failure to get the required building permits and required inspections is not only versus the law, but may provide significant and possibly expensive problems later.</p>
<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more vulnerable and breakable to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are vulnerable to corrosion and rust while some are untouched.
