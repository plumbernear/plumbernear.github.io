<p>Stegle states that when they are dealing with a client on a customized home, they will work directly with the house owner when it concerns selecting faucets and other components. As a subcontractor, those choices may have already been made. We have developed a group of contractors we have actually worked for in the past, and this has actually resulted in some service that has not involved competitive bidding," Stegle says.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-lived connection between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of solidity ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
