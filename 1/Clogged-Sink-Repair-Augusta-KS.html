<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh.

Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
