<p>These valves have a lot of versatility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention alternatives, but they likewise offer the least quantity of defense. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc increases and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to allow air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>

A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system.
