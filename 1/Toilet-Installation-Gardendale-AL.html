<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our rigid trust certification standards. A good guideline is to replace faucets that show rust, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages.

If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we advise a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
