<p>Two styles of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve.

<p>The typical service is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately suffers from rust and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
