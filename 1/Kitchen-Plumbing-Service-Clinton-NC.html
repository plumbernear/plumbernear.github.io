<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>This is the product that you probably first picture when you think about a hot water heater. An upright cylindrical tank that heats a set amount of water, with either gas or electricity, and is offered when your faucets and shower need it. It's a very quickly, powerful method that has been the norm for many years. The integrated water and area heaters are a reliable and effective choice that can be used to warm up your house along with heat water for domestic purposes.</p>
