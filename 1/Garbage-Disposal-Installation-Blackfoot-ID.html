<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is very important to the security of your clients and employees. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do it all. Slide the new water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to fulfill the brand-new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings. Balance out the lines as required with pairs of 45-degree elbows if the tubing does not line up.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, collected food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will cause problems. There are a variety of ways property owners can unclog a kitchen sink, including using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using a solution of vinegar and baking soda. For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
