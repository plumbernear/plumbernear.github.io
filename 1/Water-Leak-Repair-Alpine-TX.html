<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were wonderful. They quickly found the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess.

I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either large or little job plumbing work.</p>
