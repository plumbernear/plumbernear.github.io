<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
