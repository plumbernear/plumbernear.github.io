<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Kent WA 98042</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
