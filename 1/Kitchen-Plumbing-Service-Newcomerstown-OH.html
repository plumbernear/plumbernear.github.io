<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
