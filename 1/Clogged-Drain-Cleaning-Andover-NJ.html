<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working correctly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality. Call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing examined and we will let you understand if a repipe in Brenham is ideal for you.</p>
