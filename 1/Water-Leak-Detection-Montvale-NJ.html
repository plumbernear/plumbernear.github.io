<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. , if you prepare to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>

<p>The normal option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually experiences deterioration and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
