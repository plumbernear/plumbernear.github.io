<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our stiff trust certification requirements. A good guideline is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and wore away parts make repairs expensive and hard, suggesting a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the correct fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
