<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide.

If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
