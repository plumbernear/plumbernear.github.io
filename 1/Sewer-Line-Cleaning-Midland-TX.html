Trees and shrubs are a common reason for sewer obstructions to the home. Roots can become the smallest crack or gap in your house's drain pipe, where they thrive in the nutrient abundant environment supplied by the sewer.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank need to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may supply a fast fix in the short term, it can trigger much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

<p>For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank.

I recently needed to replace the water heater in my house and it was only 6 years of ages. Traditional hot water heater with a tank should generally last 10 to 15 years. I likewise have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been used in more than two years. Washing meals is my least preferred task, especially without the help of a dishwasher.</p>
