<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
