A great guideline is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages.

Repairs are the appropriate fix for issues such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
