<h3>Broken Pipe in South San Francisco California</h2>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable water system and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be installed.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
