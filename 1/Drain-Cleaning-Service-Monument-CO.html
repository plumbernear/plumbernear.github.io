<p>If you discover an odor or undesirable odor coming from your unit, which is not unusual, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are extensively available and simple to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the water supply to your house at the main line.
