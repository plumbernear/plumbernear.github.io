<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Monroe Township NJ</h3>
<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a small round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line during installation. Fewer parts in the unit lead to fewer tankless water heater repair visits.</p>
