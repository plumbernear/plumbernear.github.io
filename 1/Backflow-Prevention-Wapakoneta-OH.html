<p>Leaks are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.
