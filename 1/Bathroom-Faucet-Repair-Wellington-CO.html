<p>No other room in a house contains as numerous pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom.

<p>Without a water softener, laundry demands extra detergent to avoid it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher stained and streaked. Filmy residue builds up on your shower drapes and your soap and hair shampoo will not lather. Bathing in hard water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair sticky and lifeless.
