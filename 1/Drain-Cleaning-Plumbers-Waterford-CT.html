<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Waterford CT</h3>
<p>A lot of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the outer finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hoses: The extremely harmful insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company employee had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the supply of water system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through the house into the water system.</p>
