<p>The typical cost of a batch feed waste disposal unit is $100-$ 350 across the country, depending upon the size and design. They are safer to utilize than continuous feed disposals, but are not recommended for homes that generate a great deal of food waste. Rather of a switch, the batch feed garbage disposal is triggered by putting a stopper in the sink drain.</p>
