<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in South Yarmouth MA 02664</h3>
<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in various parts of the plumbing system, most commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow concerns and even stop a component from flowing altogether. The next typical problem that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it decreases the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
