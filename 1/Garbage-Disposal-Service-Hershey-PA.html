When hydraulic conditions within any water supply differ "regular," the instructions of water circulation can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the potential for contaminated water going into the drinkable water circulation system.</p>
<p>Regrettably, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for long periods of time.

<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water saves you cash. Decreased Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>

<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
