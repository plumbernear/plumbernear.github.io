<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation. On average, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have actually professional repairs done by a plumber.

<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these little deposits are harmless, however in time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
