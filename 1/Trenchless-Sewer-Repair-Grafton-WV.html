<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, frequently called "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the different jurisdictions within the State; reduce the building's energy and water usage; decrease waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.
