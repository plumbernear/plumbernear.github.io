<p>Leaks are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
