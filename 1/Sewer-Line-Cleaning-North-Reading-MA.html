Unscrew the cover from the disposer's electrical compartment.</p>
<p>DCVs are particularly created to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The pillar for regular fire defense applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two separately operating spring-loaded check valves (generally inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve.
