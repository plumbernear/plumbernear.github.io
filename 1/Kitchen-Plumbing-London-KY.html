<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service London KY</h3>
<p>Most homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden pipes: The highly harmful insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company worker had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through the house into the water system.</p>
