These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to remove. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most common indications that your system is at the end of its lifespan, particularly if they are causing major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
