<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.
