<p>In the 1990 ′ s, dry spell conditions inspired water service providers to carry out water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant blockages: If the plunger has ended up being a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous obstructions show your toilet no longer has the power needed to successfully eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may need a little various steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job.

You might not discover an identical match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
