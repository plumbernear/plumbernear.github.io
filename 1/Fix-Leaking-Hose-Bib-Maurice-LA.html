<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Maurice LA</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
