For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
