Our Tru-Soft ® Solar Crystals fulfill AWWA requirements and are certified with NSF.

Our plumbers have the proficiency and qualifications to deal with any plumbing repair or installation rapidly and securely.</p>
<p>Water softeners leaks are mostly caused because of a problem at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed with time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration processes. A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely cracked and just requires to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
