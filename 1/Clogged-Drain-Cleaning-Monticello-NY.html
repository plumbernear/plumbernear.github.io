<h3>Toilet Drain in Monticello New York</h2>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they degrade over decades.
