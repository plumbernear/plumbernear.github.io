<p>A continuous-feed waste disposal unit is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating big quantities of food waste. The majority of garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is much safer to have a vibrating system come unplugged then detached from fixed electrical wiring.
