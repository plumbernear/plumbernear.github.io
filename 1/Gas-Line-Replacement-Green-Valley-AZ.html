<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
