<p>It is vital that the system and garbage disposal plumbing are in excellent working order to avoid kitchen drain obstructions or backups if you have a garbage disposal. Waste disposal unit can be damaged if non-food items like silverware, sponges, or straws end up in the device.

<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
