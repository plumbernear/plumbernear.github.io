<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors.

Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
