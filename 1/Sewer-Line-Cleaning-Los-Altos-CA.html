<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
