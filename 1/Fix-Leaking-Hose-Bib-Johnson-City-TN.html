To secure water quality, backflow protection is needed where completion user positions a risk of contaminating the city's water supply.</p>

<p>When compared to gas models, electric models are easier and less costly to install as electrical energy is currently readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line has to be installed and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated appropriately using vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electric models, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
