<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health hazard conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
