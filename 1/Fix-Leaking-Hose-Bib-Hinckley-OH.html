<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
