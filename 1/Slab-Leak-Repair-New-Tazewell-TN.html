<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
