<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>

And it just so occurs that our bathroom and kitchen sinks start breaking down at the most troublesome times, like when we're having over supper visitors, or when we're running late for work in the early morning.

<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to protect them from water damage and dust during the work.

You can set up to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel if you want.</p>
