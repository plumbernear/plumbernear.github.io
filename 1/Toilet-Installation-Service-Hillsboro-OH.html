<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair in Hillsboro Ohio</h2>
<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to many different kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from rust and may put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
