<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
