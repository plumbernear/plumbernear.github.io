<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Property owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage issues. Once a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to get rid of any stuck-on particles.
