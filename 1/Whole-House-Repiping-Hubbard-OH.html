<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
