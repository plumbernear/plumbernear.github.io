<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Rialto CA 92376</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
