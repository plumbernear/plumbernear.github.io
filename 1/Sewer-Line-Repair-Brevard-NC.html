<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Brevard NC</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Whenever you turn on a hot water tap in your house, cold water gets in the heater through a pipe. The sensing unit inside the heater turns on an electric aspect or a burner depending upon the kind of tankless heater you have actually picked.
