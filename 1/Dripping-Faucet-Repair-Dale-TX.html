<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves).

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
