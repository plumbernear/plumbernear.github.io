<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater replacement, repair or maintenance, you can expect professional service from knowledgeable plumbing specialists. Backflow prevention gadgets run by allowing water to stream in only one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a structure or component. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow backwards into the drinkable water system. To protect water quality, backflow security is needed where the end user presents a risk of polluting the city's water system.</p>
