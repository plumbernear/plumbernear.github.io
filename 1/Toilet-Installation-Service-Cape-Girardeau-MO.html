<p>A water softener is composed of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It gathers hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are typically utilized for water softening. When an ion exchanger is looked for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as sodium or potassium. The result of our innovative water softener technology is healthier, smoother water for you and your household, while still maintaining an efficient flow rate.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex scientific process, but simple to fix. It utilizes salt to eliminate minerals and smells found in difficult water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that draw in and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
