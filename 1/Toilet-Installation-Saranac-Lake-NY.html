<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. A lot of kitchen sink blockages are due to heavy grease accumulation and food particles.

Explore our water softener collection and take pleasure in better water for bathing and home appliances.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to take a look at. You might need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is relatively brand-new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing information.
