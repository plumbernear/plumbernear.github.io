That's where underground rain gutter drains are handy. They connect to the downspouts on your house and relocation water away from the foundation underground. Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them resembles a procedure utilized to clear particles from the side rain gutter pipes on your house.</p>

If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to identify.</p>
