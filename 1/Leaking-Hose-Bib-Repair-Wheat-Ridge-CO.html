<p>No hot water-- The absence of warm water is the greatest sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater. You may have sediment that has constructed up in the system and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting enough hot water for your shower. If your hot water heater isn't doing its only task, it's time to speak with the professionals.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
