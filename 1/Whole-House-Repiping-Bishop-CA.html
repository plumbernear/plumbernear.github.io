<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the house. Normally, the water system to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
