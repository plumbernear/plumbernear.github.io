Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
