<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

Connect the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the installing ring to the flange from underneath the sink. Make sure you snap the backup ring in place.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
