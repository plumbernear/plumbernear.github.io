<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home.

<p>Tankless electrical water heaters been available in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are large and powerful enough to supply warm water to all restrooms, kitchen areas, and devices in a house.
