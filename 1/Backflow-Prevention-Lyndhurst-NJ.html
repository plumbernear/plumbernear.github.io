<p>Older plumbing systems might have pipes that corrode with time, causing leakages or other problems. Additionally, rust or other buildups in the pipes can restrict airflow and make it impossible to utilize one or more of your gas-powered appliances like the clothes dryer or stove.

When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed gradually. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is most likely cracked and just needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>

However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
