<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the house.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.
