<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, commonly referred to as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to attain consistency among the numerous jurisdictions within the State; minimize the structure's energy and water usage; lower waste; and decrease the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

Toilets differ in design, flushing performance and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more costly than others.
