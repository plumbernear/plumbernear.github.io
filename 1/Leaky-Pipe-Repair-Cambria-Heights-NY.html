<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
