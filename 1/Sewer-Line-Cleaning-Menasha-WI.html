<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation instructions within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

A hot water heater is essentially a household appliance that includes a gas or electrical heating system under a tank in which water is warmed and stored.

<p>Changing your flapper might require slightly different actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, however chances are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
