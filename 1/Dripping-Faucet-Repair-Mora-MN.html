<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them difficult to remove. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are among the most typical signs that your system is at completion of its lifespan, particularly if they are causing significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
