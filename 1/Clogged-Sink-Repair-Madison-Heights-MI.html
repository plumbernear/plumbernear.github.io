<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is proud to use Bio-Clean items for each drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is an all-natural service that's both safe to your plumbing and incredibly effective at eliminating gunk, waste, and natural material that so often congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partly repairing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively look for natural material and eat away at it, developing safe byproducts of carbon mineral, dioxide, and water ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
