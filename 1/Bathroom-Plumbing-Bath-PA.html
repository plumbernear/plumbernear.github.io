<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
