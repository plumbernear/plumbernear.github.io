<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically two layers of protection. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong method. There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device.

Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed.
