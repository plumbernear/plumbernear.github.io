<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
