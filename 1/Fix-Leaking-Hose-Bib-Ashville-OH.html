<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to eliminate chloride.

In homes with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic tank and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Depending upon the level of the clog, we may use a variety of different techniques, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative type of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to completely clear out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and get rid of wire connectors. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp port and get rid of wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage concerns. When a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to get rid of any stuck-on particles. Put hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the garbage disposal to get rid of grease. Another excellent technique is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
