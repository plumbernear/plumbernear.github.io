Continuous feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, nevertheless, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can in some cases get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and require repairs.</p>

Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
