<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.
