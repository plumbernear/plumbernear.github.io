<p>Tough water shortens the lifespan of lots of major devices and systems in your home due to the quantity of limescale and sediment accumulation that takes place. Limescale on pipes can trigger rust and blockages, which not only shortens the lifespan of the pipes but puts you in a position where you might need to spend for a pricey repair. Accumulation in pipes can also result in a boost of water pressure, which can harm the whole sewer system and considerably increase the opportunities of a pipe rupturing due to stress.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
