Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
