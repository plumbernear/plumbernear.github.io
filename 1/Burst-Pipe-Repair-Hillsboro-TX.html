<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Hillsboro TX 76645</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
