<p>Unless you have a crafty two-year old who likes to throw toilet tissue down the toilet, you ought to not have regular clogging problems. In truth, you must hardly ever have a clogged toilet if you are using it correctly and if it is working appropriately.

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent.

This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to go into the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
