<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Birmingham MI</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
