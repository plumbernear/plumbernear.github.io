<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe due to the fact that the plumber will need to navigate through walls to do the job. Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a huge job - and it's a job you want to get right. However the range of plumbing pipe materials to choose from can make it confusing. Here we take a look at a few of the attributes of the major pipe types to help you pick the ideal pipe for your plumbing.</p>

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
