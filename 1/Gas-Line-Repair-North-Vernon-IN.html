<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
