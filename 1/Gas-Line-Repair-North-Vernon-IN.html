<p>In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to eliminate small areas of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending upon the size of your home, this process will likely take a few days to a week to complete.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
