<p>More than frequently, little leaks in our houses are quickly repaired through welding and we neglect it as a petty problem. But if the leakage issues are regular and every now and then some or the other corner of your house has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to inspect the entire piping system to carry out house repiping. Several leakages shouldn't be neglected at all; else it may lead to complex flooding issue very soon.</p>

Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and re-install locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
