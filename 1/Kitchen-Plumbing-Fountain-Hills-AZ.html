There are 2 different kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are frequently specified-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device.

<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical.

Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
