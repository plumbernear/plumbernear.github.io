<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

Rain harvesting tanks: If a rain harvesting tank has an extra refill line connected to drinkable water, an air space or an RP backflow preventer need to be set up on the refill line. An RP on a rain harvesting system should be evaluated upon installation and after that each year.</p>
