<p>106.2.2.1 Aside From Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exclusions in Section 106.2.2 will apply to small repairs and replacement piping just. In buildings besides Group R-3 occupancies, an authorization and inspection shall be required for more extensive work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor area, wing, or level is involved, even though the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (nominal) of the total building plumbing.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
