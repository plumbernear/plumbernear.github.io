<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
