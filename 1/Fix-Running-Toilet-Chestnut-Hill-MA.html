<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
