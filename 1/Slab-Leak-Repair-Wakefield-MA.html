<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe water supply system. Stainless-steel blades are usually preferred since they're less vulnerable to rust. Other excellent options are overload protection, which turns off the motor if it starts to overheat; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the unclean dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly developed to be used with a septic system. gives an overview 1 of waste disposal unit and septic tanks.</p>
