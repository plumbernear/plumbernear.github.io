<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
