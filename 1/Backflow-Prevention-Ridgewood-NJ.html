<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
