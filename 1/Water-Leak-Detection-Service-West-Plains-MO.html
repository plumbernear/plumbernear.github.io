<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
