<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and does not have the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
