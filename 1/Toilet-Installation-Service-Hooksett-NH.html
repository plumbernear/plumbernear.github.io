<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, bathtub, or shower) can be corrected easily if the blockage is shallow and simple.
