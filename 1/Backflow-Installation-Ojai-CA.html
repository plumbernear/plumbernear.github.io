<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the potable water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be installed.

Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
