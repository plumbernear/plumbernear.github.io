<h3>Shower Repairs in Hamtramck MI 48212 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
