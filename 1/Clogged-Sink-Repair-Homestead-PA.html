<h3>Drain Cleaning in Homestead PA 15120 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated correctly in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten up the drain locknut. Lastly, turn on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>Are your plumbing pipes starting to show indications of wear? We can repipe your entire pipe system, or repair particular areas in your house or workplace the exact same day. Just like working with a plumber for basic repairs, you or your contractor ought to request proof of a license and license number. Also confirm that workers' payment and liability insurance coverage are active.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
