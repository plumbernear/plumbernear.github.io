<p>Maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from proficient plumbing professionals when you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair. Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to stream in just one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may flow backwards into the drinkable water system.
