Some softeners deal with electrical power, but some more current water softeners utilize waterpower.

<p>Lastly, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
