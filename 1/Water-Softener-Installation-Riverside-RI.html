The Culligan ® Medallist Water Softener - Functions strong building and smooth plumbing combination, offering dependable, affordable everyday water softening.

For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
