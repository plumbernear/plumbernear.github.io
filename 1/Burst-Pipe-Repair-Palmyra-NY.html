<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
