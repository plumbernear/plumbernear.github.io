<p>CPM Plumbing concentrates on speedy service, precise troubleshooting, and accuracy repairs so your business never needs to suffer from downtime. If there is a leak, one thing to know about gas lines is they can be incredibly dangerous.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
