<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to eliminate chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In homes with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>

Nonetheless, they have proven to be the most effective. Your choice depends upon what you value many. Overall, the three most important aspects for deciding in between the 2 types of waste disposers are security, cash, and amount of waste.</p>
