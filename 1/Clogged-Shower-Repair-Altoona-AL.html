<h3>Drain Cleaning in Altoona AL 35952 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Installing a new gas line in the kitchen will normally range from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe needed. If you're converting your house to natural gas, or if the current line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more. New gas line expenses consist of home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that might need a backflow device. Often conditions on properties change that may need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your organisation, they can trigger monetary losses and in some instances can stop your company entirely. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a little workplace the concerns brought on by even small drain problems can trigger major problems.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
