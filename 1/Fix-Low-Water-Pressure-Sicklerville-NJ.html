<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does happen regularly than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a few minutes, typically it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
