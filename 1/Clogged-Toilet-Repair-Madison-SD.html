<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Madison SD</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The highly poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company worker had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your home into the water supply.</p>
