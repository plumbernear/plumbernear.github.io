Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
