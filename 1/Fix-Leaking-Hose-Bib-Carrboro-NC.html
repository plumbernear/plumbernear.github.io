<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Carrboro NC</h3>
<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, particularly if that water is hot, the inside of your system is probably rusty. You will likely have to replace your hot water heater if it just takes place with hot water. If you're like many homeowners, you most likely do not understand what kind of pipes you have. A plumber from 1st Option Plumbing can tell you for sure, but in basic, there are 3 main kinds of pipes that tend to have problems.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
