<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Bath NY</h3>
<p>We're replacing a natural gas water heater in our presentation. The actions for changing a lp hot water heater are exactly the exact same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. Repeating repairs and leaks. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
