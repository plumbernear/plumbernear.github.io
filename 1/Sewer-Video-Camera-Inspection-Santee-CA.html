Fruit and Drain Flies - Do you notice small flies spending time your sink? This may be an indication of a clogged drain. When garbage, sewage, and waste clog a drain, they bring in flies. Both the flies and the clogged drains can position a hazard which is why it is necessary to have a professional clean your drains.</p>
<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your sink, tub or shower. With time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them difficult to eliminate.
