However, if you notice any of these problems, you ought to give your local, trusted plumber a call.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair costs might be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
