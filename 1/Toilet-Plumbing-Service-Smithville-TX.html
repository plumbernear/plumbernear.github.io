<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust certification standards. A great rule of thumb is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and wore away parts make repairs pricey and tough, suggesting a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
