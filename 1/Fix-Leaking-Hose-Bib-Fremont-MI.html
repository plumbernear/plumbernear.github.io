<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
