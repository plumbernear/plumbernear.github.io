<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
