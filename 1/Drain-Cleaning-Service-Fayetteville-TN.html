<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
