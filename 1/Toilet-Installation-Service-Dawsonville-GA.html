For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
