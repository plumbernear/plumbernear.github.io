<p>If you're living with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and unlimited appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener. Hard water is not a problem that will disappear on its own and the expenses incurred by difficult water will just continue to intensify. With a water softener, devices will inevitably fail quicker than their expected lifespan. Your flow rate will continue to limit and you risk losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to accumulate in your pipes. Difficult water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your energy costs will continue to barrel skyward. The perpetual cycle of repairs and replacements will continue until your house is protected by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
