Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

One method to evaluate for any leaks in your plumbing is to turn off all water home appliances in the house and outdoors (sprinklers, tubes, and so on).
