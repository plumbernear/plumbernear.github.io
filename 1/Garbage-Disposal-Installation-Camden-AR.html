<p>If the water feels warm, then the heating component is taking longer to heat up the water than it should. But this specific issue is when you have no hot water flowing in your house. The reasons for this can range from leakages, faulty or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is one of the pointed out concerns, a repair or replacement of the parts might be sufficient. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems occurring regularly, then a hot water heater replacement is needed.</p>

You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to make sure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
