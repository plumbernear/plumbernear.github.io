<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular event, however it does happen more often than you think! When you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
