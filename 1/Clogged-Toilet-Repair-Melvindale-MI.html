<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Melvindale MI</h3>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your backyard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical option, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
