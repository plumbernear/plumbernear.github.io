<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. With time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them challenging to eliminate. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are among the most common indications that your system is at the end of its life expectancy, specifically if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
