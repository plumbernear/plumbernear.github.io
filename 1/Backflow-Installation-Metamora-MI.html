<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Contractor in Metamora</h2>

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the degree of the rot.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
