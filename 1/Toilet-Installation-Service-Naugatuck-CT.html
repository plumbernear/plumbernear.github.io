New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to the City of Bellingham.

When you add a water softener, it removes the mineral content to produce odorless drinking water that tastes good.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
