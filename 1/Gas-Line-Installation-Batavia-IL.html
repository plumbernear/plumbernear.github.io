<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time related. If whatever is all set, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and therefore the total expenses. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
