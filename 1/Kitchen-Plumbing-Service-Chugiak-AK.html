The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>

<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health hazard if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place must be indicated on building plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond should be checked upon installation and after that yearly.</p>

Then they are replaced in the option by the salt ions.</p>
