<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline prior to the issue became worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly option.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
