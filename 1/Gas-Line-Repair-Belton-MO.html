<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps record wetness and sediment so that they don't go into the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install. The City needs backflow prevention gadgets to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that could enable tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These gadgets undergo testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they undergo routine tests later on, as well.</p>
