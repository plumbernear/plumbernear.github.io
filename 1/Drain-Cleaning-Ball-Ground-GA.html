<p>Tough water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>To get rid of the smells, first try putting BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also try 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a couple of minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Unattainable or insufficient cleanouts: No matter how effective a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged eventually. House owners and plumbers need to be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this takes place. Buildings without sufficient cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at danger of a pipe bursting.</p>
