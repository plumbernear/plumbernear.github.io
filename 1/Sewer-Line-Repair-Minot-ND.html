<p>When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized.
