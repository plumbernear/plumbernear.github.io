<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to many different types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from deterioration and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your home. This may not require completely repiping the house, since newer materials might have currently been utilized in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you pinpoint precisely what work needs to be done.</p>
