<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may appear like a waste of money. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners might be an economical solution, the severe active ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, with time, producing vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to rupture. Handling repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the savings sustained from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>

<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and mixed with water. , if you plan to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>

A repipe is more involved than fixing a clogged toilet and even repairing a single pipe. With a repipe, you will be replacing your entire water system system in your home.</p>
