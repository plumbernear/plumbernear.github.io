<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
