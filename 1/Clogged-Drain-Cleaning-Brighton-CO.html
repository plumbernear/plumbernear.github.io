<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Houses that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; obtain the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
