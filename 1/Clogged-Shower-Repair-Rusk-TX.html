<p>Thank you a lot for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had been on trip throughout the time of repair and it was reassuring to know it had been taken care of and prepared to go upon our return. For a plumber concentrating on drain-clearing services, anticipate to pay a minimum of $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines.
