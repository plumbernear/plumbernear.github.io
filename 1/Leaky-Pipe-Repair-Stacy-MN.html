Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off.

One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
