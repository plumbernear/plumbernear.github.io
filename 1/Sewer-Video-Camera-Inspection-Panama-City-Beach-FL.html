<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
