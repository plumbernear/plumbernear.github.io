<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Contractor in North Brunswick</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or damaged, it could wreak unwelcome issues on your home. A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
