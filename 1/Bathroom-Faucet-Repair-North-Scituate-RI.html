<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
