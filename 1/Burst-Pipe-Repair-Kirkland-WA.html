<p>You can also depend upon water softeners to minimize your day-to-day operating costs by conserving cleaning agent and enabling you to utilize lower water temperature levels while keeping a high-quality wash. Water firmness, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, differs throughout the U.S. from a little hard (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
<p>The report will use one or both of these systems to inform you how difficult your water is if you have your water checked. Because the level of calcium carbonate implies little to water customers, water experts have actually classified levels of hardness. Table 1 shows these classifications. Check Valve assemblies are the most common type used on irrigation systems in Horseshoe Bay.</p>
