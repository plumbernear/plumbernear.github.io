<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
