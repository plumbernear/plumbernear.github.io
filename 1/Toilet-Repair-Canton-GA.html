Throughout regeneration, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
