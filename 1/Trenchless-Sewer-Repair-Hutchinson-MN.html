No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does happen regularly than you believe! When you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
