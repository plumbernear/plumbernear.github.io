There are only many repairs that you can make before you need a new toilet, right?

You can buy a disposal that already has a cord connected if you're not comfortable making electrical connections for your garbage disposal installation. Ask at your house center or appliance store, or search online for 'waste disposal unit with cable connected.</p>
<p>The typical time to install or replace a garbage disposal varies from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour. The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will trigger your water to look brown or rusty, and the water may have a bad or nasty odor to it.
