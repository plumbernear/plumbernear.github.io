<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
