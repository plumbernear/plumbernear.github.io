<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Highland Park MI</h3>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
