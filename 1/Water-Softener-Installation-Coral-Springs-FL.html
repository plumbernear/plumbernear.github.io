<h3>Prices For Unclogging And Video Inspection Coral Springs FL</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
