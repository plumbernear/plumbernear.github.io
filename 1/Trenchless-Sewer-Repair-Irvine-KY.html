Bugs and rats can quickly squeeze through fractures and gaps in your sewer line and discover their way into your plumbing. These insects can be extremely damaging to your health. If you presume you have bugs in your plumbing, a plumber can carry out a visual inspection of your sewer line.</p>

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
