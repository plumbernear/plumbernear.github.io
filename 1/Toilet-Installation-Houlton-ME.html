When you experience blockages in multiple drains simultaneously in your home, then that usually implies that your main sewer line is supporting. This can happen in several areas and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
