<p>Debris such as foreign items - Things such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become trapped between your drainpipe and your pipes. These will ultimately obstruct the circulation of your water prior to causing a clog. Also, if too much toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or sanitary items are flushed, a clog can happen.
