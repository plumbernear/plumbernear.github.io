<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters must be able to lift and move heavy tools and products. Suggestion: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening gradually from the within. Most of the times, repiping is your only feasible option.</p>
