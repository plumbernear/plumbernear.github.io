It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
