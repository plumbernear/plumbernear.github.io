<h3>Toilet Drain in Portland Tennessee</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have actually achieved a breakthrough in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically gets rid of temporary solidity without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant restrictions of existing softening technologies.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
