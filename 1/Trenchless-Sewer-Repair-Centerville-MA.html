<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were wonderful. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, just like everyone we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and very well-informed. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either little or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Tankless electric hot water heater come in two types. There are whole-house heaters that are big and effective enough to provide warm water to all restrooms, kitchens, and home appliances in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that provide warm water to particular spaces or devices only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the exact same method. The only difference is the amount of water they can warm up at any offered time. Likewise, whole-house units are significantly more costly than the point of usage systems.</p>
