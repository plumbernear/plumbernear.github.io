<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of items to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated. The installation must be examined to guarantee it does not prevent the workings of the assembly. Test data should be accumulated to determine the workings of each element. The backflow prevention assembly need to be disassembled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be tested again to be sure it was appropriately fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the makers flowchart is needed to guarantee it was repaired effectively. An appropriately fixed assembly must offer years of defense.</p>
