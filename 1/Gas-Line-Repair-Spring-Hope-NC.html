Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would usually trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually end up being broken and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater extremely quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the brand-new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing strategies are not required for one- and two-family homes or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
