This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
