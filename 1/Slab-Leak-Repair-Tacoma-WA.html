<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Tacoma WA</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you select should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed need to have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly includes an inlet and outlet shut off, appropriately located test dicks, and the essential components of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each component can even more be broken down into its parts. For instance a first check is a component. A part can further be broken down into its specific parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make components, and parts are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
